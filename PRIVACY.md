# Privacy Policy

## Data Handling
Betherscan does not collect, track, store, or handle any personal data. That's it.

## Permissions
Betherscan requires the "host permissions" to access blockchain explorer pages such as Etherscan. This permission enables the extension to inject content scripts that display additional information on these pages. No personal data is processed or affected by these scripts.
